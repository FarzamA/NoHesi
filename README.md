# No Hesi

## Background 

The no hesi game is made for players that are itching to speed down a highway 
weaving through traffic as if it isn't even there. The game is very simple and has a basic flow. You are the driver of a car and your goal is to speed along the highway for as long as possible, while collecting nitrous cannisters that are in the road on the way. 

## Functionality & MVPs

In No Hesi, users will be able to: 
* Select the color of the car they want to drive
* Drive a car in order to avoid other cars/obstacles
* Use the "SHIFT" key in order to use whatever item the player has picked up
* Have access to a score tracker that increments based on the amount of time a player has gone without crashing as well as when a player picks up an item

In addition, this project will include: 
* The use of threejs in order to render 3d models for a more interactive game 
* A production README 
* Instructions on how to play the game
